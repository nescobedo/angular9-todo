<h1 align="center">Angular 9<br>Todo List using In-Memory-web-api</h1>
This is my Angular 9 CRUD application.  It is a basic Todo app that uses the in-memory-web-api to replicate calls.  
  
This app also includes Bootstrap 4(scss) and Prettier. It uses the messaging service from Angular's Tour of Heroes tutorial to show api requests.

* https://www.techiediaries.com/angular-inmemory-web-api/ - This one got me started but did not give a complete view of how data is updated to the app. 

* https://www.concretepage.com/angular/angular-crud - This worked great, I based initial requests from this repo.

* http://www.angulartodo.com/code.html  - I used this example to help simplify my form. 

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNCzuSryJHE  - I used this as a basis for styling.  

* https://stackblitz.com/angular/vnyxovpppxr?file=src%2Fapp%2Fhttp-error-handler.service.ts - google's official implementation but I ended up using their error handling and messaging features.
